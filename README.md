# ap-calculators-bc
I smushed together two Javascript libraries, Mathquill and Nerdamer, to help people do their calculus homework.
I'm aware of a few bugs regarding natural log.

Warning: I ran out of money to host the website, so the link will not work anymore.

# Project details:
- Built in the vanilla front-end framework (HTML,CSS, JS)
- Achieved up to 14,000 clicks/day (average of 100 clicks/day over the 2-year period it was running) (according to my hosting service, Hostinger)
- Website was up from Sep 2022 - Sep 2024
- Contained a number of resources to assist calculus students, like tutorials, explanations, and calculators that I coded to solve derivatives, integrals, Euler's method, arclength, etc. Basically, any algebra/calculus you had to do in AP Calc BC, there was a calculator for it.

# What I learned:
- Was my first coding project! So I learned lots about the front-end (like asset minification, CDNs, image tracing)
